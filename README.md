# Tea Crate
There are plenty of tea drinkers out there. Some drink tea every other day, for others (like myself) love ourselves a tea party. Like a candy store, there's just too many types of tea to choose from. From the traditionalist/purist tea fan to the modern tea drinker, this app will help categorize the teas they've tried. Hopefully, starting a tea party or hosting brunch would surely be a breeze with this app in hopes of choosing the right cup of tea.

This app focuses on Sinatra and RESTful Routes.
